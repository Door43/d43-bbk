One of the leaders in the early Church was a man named Stivə̀n. He had a good reputation and was full of theKəzhwì kə nwoʔə kə and of wisdom. Stivə̀n did many miracles and reasoned persuasively that people should believe in Yesù.

One day, when Stivə̀n was teaching about Yesù , Vəju vətsenəvə who did not believe in Yesù began to argue with Stivə̀n. They became very angry and lied about Stivə̀n to the religious leaders. They said, “We heard him speak evil things about Musìs bɛ̀nə̀ Nyìngòŋ !” So the religious leaders arrested Stivə̀n and brought him to the kəchu kə nshə̀ʔtə̀sə ə̀ əngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ and the other əchu əchu ə Vəju, where more false witnesses lied about Stivə̀n.

Kəchu kə nshə̀ʔtə̀sə ə̀ əngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ kə bə̀m à Stivə̀n, “Are these things true?” Stivə̀n replied by reminding them of many of the great things Nyìngòŋ had done from the time of Abraham to the time of Yesù , and how viʔi ə Nyìngòŋ continually disobeyed him. Then he said, “You stubborn and rebellious people always reject the Kəzhwì kə nwoʔə kə , just as your ancestors always rejected Nyìngòŋ and killed his prophets. But you did something worse than they did! You killed the Messiah!”

When the religious leaders heard this, they were so angry that they covered their ears and yelled loudly. They dragged Stivə̀n out of the city and threw stones at him in order to kill him.

As Stivə̀n was dying, he cried out, “Yesù , receive my spirit.” Then he fell to his knees and cried out again, “Master, do not count this sin against them.” Then he died.

A young man named Saul agreed with the people who killed Stivə̀n and guarded their robes while they threw stones at him. That day, many people in Jerusalem started persecuting the followers of Yesù , so the believers fled to other places. But in spite of this, they preached about Yesù everywhere they went.

Ndzɨ̀mtə̀ Yesù ə tsen və dzàŋə̀ nə̀ Fili b was one of the believers who fled from Jerusalem during the persecution. He went to Samaria where he preached about Yesù and many people were saved. Then one day, ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ əngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ gàʔ a  Filib la ghə̀ djʉ̀ a jì ə tsen ghə̀ zɨmə tà la kwas.

When Fili b approached the chariot, he heard  wù əloʔ ə Itopyà reading from what the prophet Isaiah wrote. The man read, “They led him like a lamb to be killed, and as a lamb is silent, he did not say a word. They treated him unfairly and did not respect him. They took his life away from him.”

Fili b bə̀m à wù əloʔ ə Itopy à , “Do you understand what you are reading?” Wù əloʔ ə Itopy à replied, “No. I cannot understand it unless someone explains it to me. Please come and sit next to me. Was Isaiah writing about himself or someone else?”

Fili b explained to wù əloʔ ə Itopy à that Isaiah was writing about Yesù . Fili b also used other scriptures to tell him the good news about Yesù .
