Throughout the history of the Israelites, Nyìngòŋ sent them nshə̀ʔtə̀sə . The Nshə̀ʔtə̀sə heard messages from Nyìngòŋ and then told the people Nyìngòŋ messages.

Elajà was a prophet when Ahàb was king over the kingdom of Israel. Ahàb was an evil man who encouraged people to worship a false yyìngòŋ named Bal. Elajà said to Ahàb, “There will be no rain or dew in the kingdom of Israel until I say so.” This made Ahàb very angry.

Nyìngòŋ told Elajà to go to a stream in the wilderness to hide from Ahàb who wanted to kill him. Every morning and every evening, birds would bring him bread and meat. Ahàb and his army looked for Elajà , but they could not find him. The drought was so severe that the stream eventually dried up.

So Elajà went to a neighboring country. A widow and her son in that country had almost run out of food because the lack of rain had caused a famine. But they took care of Elajà , and Nyìngòŋ provided for them so that their flour jar and their bottle of oil never became empty. They had food through the whole famine. Elajà stayed there for several years.

After three and a half years, Nyìngòŋ told Elajà to return to the kingdom of Israel and speak with Ahàb because he was going to send rain again. When Ahàb saw Elajà he said, “There you are, you troublemaker!” Elajà replied to him, “You are the troublemaker! You have abandoned Yawè, the true Nyìngòŋ , and worshiped Bal. Bring all the people of the kingdom of Israel to Mount Carmel.”

All the people of the kingdom of Israel, including the 450 nshə̀ʔtə̀sə of Bal, came to Mount Carmel. Elajà said to the people, “How long will you keep changing your mind? If Yawè is Nyìngòŋ , serve him! If Bal is Nyìngòŋ , serve him!”

Then Elajà said to the nshə̀ʔtə̀sə Bal, “Kill a bull and prepare it as a sacrifice, but do not light the fire. I will do the same. The Nyìngòŋ who answers with fire is the real Nyìngòŋ .” So the priests of Bal prepared a sacrifice but did not light the fire.

Then the Nshə̀ʔtə̀sə Bal prayed to Bal, “Hear us, Bal!” All day long they prayed and shouted and even cut themselves with knives, but there was no answer.

At the end of the day, Elajà prepared a sacrifice to Nyìngòŋ . Then he told the people to pour twelve huge pots of water on top of the sacrifice until the meat, the wood, and even the ground around the altar were completely wet.

Then Elajà prayed, “Yawè , Nyìngòŋ of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the Nyìngòŋ of Israel and that I am your servant. Answer me so that these people will know that you are the true Nyìngòŋ .”

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-11.jpg?direct&}}

Immediately, fire fell from the sky and burned up the meat, the wood, the rocks, the dirt, and even the water that was around the altar. When the people saw this, they fell on the ground and said, “Yawè dìʔ Nyìngòŋ ! Yawè dìʔ  Nyìngòŋ !”

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-12.jpg?direct&}}

Then Elajà said, “Do not let any of the nshə̀ʔtə̀sə Bal escape!” So the people captured the nshə̀ʔtə̀sə Bal and took them away from there and killed them.

Then Elajà said to King Ahàb, “Return immediately to the city, because the rain is coming.” Soon the sky grew black, and a heavy rain began. Yawè had ended the drought and proved that he is the true Nyìngòŋ .

After the time of Elajà , Nyìngòŋ chose a man named Elishà to be his prophet. Nyìngòŋ did many miracles through Elishà. One of the miracles happened to Namàn, an enemy commander, who had a horrible skin disease. He had heard of Elishà so he went and asked Elishà to heal him. Elishà told Namàn to dip himself seven times in the Jodàn River.

At first Naaman was angry and would not do it because it seemed foolish. But later he changed his mind and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan River. When he came up the last time, his skin was completely healed! Nyìngòŋ had healed him.

Nyìngòŋ sent many other Nshə̀ʔtə̀sə. They all told the people to stop worshiping idols and to start showing justice and mercy to others. Nshə̀ʔtə̀sə warned the people that if they did not stop doing evil and start obeying Nyìngòŋ , then Nyìngòŋ would judge them as guilty, and he would punish them.

Most of the time, the people did not obey Nyìngòŋ . They often mistreated the nshə̀ʔtə̀sə and sometimes even killed them. Once, the nshə̀ʔtə̀ Jèrìmayà was put into a dry well and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the king had mercy on him and ordered his servants to pull Jèrìmayà out of the well before he died.
