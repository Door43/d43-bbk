Through the prophet Jeremiah, Nyìngòŋ promised that he would make a New Covenant, but not like the covenant Nyìngòŋ made with Israel at Sinai. In the New Covenant, Nyìngòŋ would write his law on the people’s hearts, the people would know Nyìngòŋ personally, they would be his people, and Nyìngòŋ would forgive their sins. The Mèzayà would start the New Covenant.
