In the past, Nyìngòŋ had spoken to his people through his ntsɨ̀ŋsə ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ and prophets. But then 400 years went by when he did not speak to them. Suddenly an ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ came with a message from Nyìngòŋ to an old priest named Zèkàriyà . Zèkàriyà and his wife, Elizabèt, viʔi a və fwanə̀ Nyìngòŋ , but she had not been able to have any children.

Ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ said to Zèkàriyà, “Your wife will have a son. You will name him John. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, and will prepare the people for the Messiah!” Zèkàriyà responded, “My wife and I are too old to have children! How can I know this will happen?”

Ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ responded to Zèkàriyà , “I was sent by Nyìngòŋ to bring you this good news. Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born.” Immediately, Zèkàriyà was unable to speak. Ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ left Zèkàriyà . After this, Zèkàriyà returned home and his wife became pregnant.

When Elizabèt was six months pregnant, the same ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ ayì suddenly appeared to Elizabèt relative, whose name was Mèri. She was a virgin and was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph. Ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ gàʔ, “You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You are to name him Jesus. He will be the Son of the Most High Nyìngòŋ and will rule forever.”

Mèri replied, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” Ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ explained, “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of Nyìngòŋ will overshadow you. So the baby will be holy, the Son of Nyìngòŋ .” Mèri believed and accepted what the ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ said.

Soon after the ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ spoke to Mèri , she went and visited Elizabèt . As soon as Elizabèt heard Mèri greeting, Elizabèt baby jumped inside her. The women rejoiced together about what Nyìngòŋ had done for them. After Mèri visited Elizabèt for three months, Mèri returned home.

After Elizabèt gave birth to her baby boy, Zèkàriyà and Elizabèt named the baby John, as the ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ had commanded. Then Nyìngòŋ allowed Zèkàriyà to speak again. Zèkàriyà said, “Praise Nyìngòŋ , because he has remembered his people! You, my son, will be called the prophet of the Most High Nyìngòŋ who will tell the people how they can receive forgiveness for their sins!”
