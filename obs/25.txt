Immediately after Yesù was baptized, the Holy Spirit led him out into the wilderness, where he fasted for forty days and forty nights. Then Satàyn came to Yesù and tempted him to sin.

Satàyn tempted Yesù by saying, “If you are the Son of God, turn these rocks into bread so you can eat!”

Yesù replied, “It is written in God’s word, ‘People do not only need bread in order to live, but they need every word that God speaks!’”

Then SatàynSatàyn took Yesù to the highest point on the Temple and said, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, because it is written, ‘God will command his angels to carry you so your foot does not hit a stone.’”

But Yesù replied to Satàyn by quoting from the Scriptures. He said, “In God’s Word, he commands his people, ‘Do not test the Lord your God.’”

Then Satàyn showed Yesù all the kingdoms of the world and all their glory and said, “I will give you all this if you bow down and worship me.”

Yesù replied, “Get away from me, Satàyn ! In God’s word he commands his people, ‘Worship only the Lord your God and only serve him.’”

Yesù did not give in to Satàyn ’s temptations, so Satàyn left him. Then angels came and took care of Yesù .
