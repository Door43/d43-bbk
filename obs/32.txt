One day, Yesù and his disciples went in a boat across the lake to the region where the Gerasene people lived.

When they reached the other side of the lake, a demon-possessed man came running up to Yesù .

This man was so strong that nobody could control him. People had even fastened his arms and legs with chains, but he kept breaking them.

The man lived among the tombs in the area. This man would scream all day and all night. He did not wear clothes and cut himself repeatedly with stones.

When the man came to Yesù, he fell on his knees in front of him. Yesù said to the demon, “Come out of this man!”

The man with the demon cried out in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Yesù , Wàyn ə̀ Nyìngòŋ a ghə̀ dìʔ a əkaŋ? Please do not torture me!” Then Yesù asked the demon, “What is your name?” He replied, “My name is Legion, because we are many.” (A “legion” was a group of several thousand soldiers in the Roman army.)

Vədeblə̀ avyi loyn Yesù , “Please do not send us out of this region!” There was a herd of vənkwʉnyàm feeding on a nearby hill. Və deblə̀ avyi loyn Yesù , “Nsensen bòŋsə̀ tɨm yès a tinsə ə̀ vənkwʉnyàm!” Yesù gàʔ , “Djʉ̀ə!”

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-08.jpg?direct&}}

Və deblə̀ avyi came out of the man and entered the vənkwʉnyàm . Vənkwʉnyàm ran down a steep bank into the lake and drowned. There were about 2,000 vənkwʉnyàm in the herd.

When the people who took care of the vənkwʉnyàm saw what happened, they ran into the town and told everyone that they met what Yesù had done. The people from the town came and saw the man who used to have the və deblə̀ . He was sitting calmly, wearing clothes, and acting like a normal person.

The people were very afraid and asked Yesù to leave. So Yesù got into the boat and prepared to leave. Wìʔ ayì a ghə̀ nkiʔə və deblə̀ li loyn Yesù la Yesù byɨmə yì vì wen ə̀ wen .

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-11.jpg?direct&}}

But Yesù said to him, “No, I want you to go home and tell your friends and family about everything that Nyìngòŋ has done for you and how he has had mercy on you.”

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-12.jpg?direct&}}

So the man went away and told everyone about what Yesù had done for him. Everyone who heard his story was filled with wonder and amazement.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-13.jpg?direct&}}

Yesù returned to the other side of the lake. After he arrived there, a large crowd gathered around him and pressed in on him. In the crowd was a woman who had suffered from a bleeding problem for twelve years. She had paid all of her money to doctors so they would heal her, but she only got worse.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-14.jpg?direct&}}

She had heard that Yesù Yesù had healed many sick people and thought, “I’m sure that if I can just touch Yesù ’ clothes, then I will be healed, too!” So she came up behind Yesù and touched his clothes. As soon as she touched them, the bleeding stopped!

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-15.jpg?direct&}}

Immediately, Yesù realized that power had gone out from him. So he turned around and asked, “Who touched me?” The disciples replied, “There are many people crowding around you and bumping into you. Why did you ask, ‘Who touched me?’”
