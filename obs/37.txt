One day, Yesù received a message that Lazaròs was very sick. Lazaròs and his two sisters, Mèri and Matà, were close friends of Yesù. When Yesù heard this news, he said, “This sickness will not end in death, but it is for the glory of Nyìngòŋ.” Yesù loved his friends, but he waited where he was for two days.

After the two days had passed, Yesù said to his disciples, “Let’s go back to Judea.” “But Teacher,” the disciples answered, “Just a short time ago the people there wanted to kill you!” Yesù said, “Our friend Lazaròs has fallen asleep, and I must wake him.”

Yesù’ disciples replied, “Masà, if Lazaròs is sleeping, then he will get better.” Then Yesù told them plainly, “Lazaròs ə pfɨ li. I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe in me.”

Yesù replied, “I am the Resurrection and the Life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though he dies. Everyone who believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” Matà answered, “Yes, Masà ! I believe you are the Messiah, Wàyn ə̀ Nyìngòŋ .”

Yesù responded, “Did I not tell you that you would see Nyìngòŋ ’s glory if you believe in me?” So they rolled the stone away.

Then Yesù looked up to heaven and said, “Father, thank you for hearing me. I know you always listen to me, but I say this for the sake of all these people standing here, so that they will believe you sent me.” Yesù dzàŋ, “Lazaròs, fʉ̀ə̀ vì!”

Lazaròs fʉ̀! He was still wrapped in grave clothes. Yesù told them, “Help him take off those grave clothes and release him!” Many of the Jews believed in Yesù because of this miracle.

But the religious leaders of the Jews were jealous, so they gathered together to plan how they could kill Yesù and Lazaròs.
