Immediately, God healed the lame man, and he began to walk and jump around, and to praise God. The people in the courtyard of the Temple were amazed.

A crowd of people quickly came to see the man who was healed. Bità gàʔ à vəwenə, “Why are you amazed that this man is healed? We did not heal him through our own power or goodness. Rather, it is the power of Yesù and the faith that Yesù gives that healed this man.”

“You are the ones who told the Roman governor to kill Yesù . You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. Although you did not understand what you were doing, God used your actions to fulfill the prophecies that the Messiah would suffer and die. So now, repent and turn to God so that your sins will be washed away.”

The leaders of the Temple were very upset by what Bità wenə̀ Jon ngàʔə̀ . So they arrested them and put them into prison. But many of the people believed Bità’s message, and the number of men who believed in Yesù grew to about 5,000.

The next day, the Jewish leaders brought Bità wenə̀ Jon to the high priest and the other religious leaders. They asked Bità wenə̀ Jon , “By what power did you heal this crippled man?”

Bità gàʔ à vəwenə, “This man stands before you healed by the power of Yesù the Messiah. You crucified Yesù , but God raised him to life again! You rejected him, but there is no other way to be saved except through the power of Yesù !”

The leaders were shocked that Bità wenə̀ Jon spoke so boldly because they could see that these men were ordinary men who were uneducated. But then they remembered that these men had been with Yesù . After they threatened Bità wenə̀ Jon , they let them go.
