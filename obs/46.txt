Sɔ was the young man who guarded the robes of the men who killed Stivə̀n. He did not believe in Yesù, and so he persecuted the Viʔ və byɨmə və. He went from house to house in Yèlusalèm to arrest both men and women and to put them in prison. The high priest gave Sɔ permission to go to the city of Dàmaskùs to arrest Viʔ və byɨmə və there and to bring them back to Yèlusalèm.

While Sɔ was on his way to Dàmaskùs, a bright light from heaven shone all around him, and he fell to the ground. Sɔ heard someone say, “Sɔ! Sɔ! Why do you persecute me?” Sɔ asked, “Who are you, Master?” Yesù replied to him, “I am Yesù. You are persecuting me!”

When Sɔ got up, he could not see. His friends had to lead him into Dàmaskùs. Sɔ did not eat or drink anything for three days.

There was a disciple in Dàmaskùs named Ananias. Nyìngòŋ said to him, “Go to the house where Sɔ is staying. Place your hands on him so that he can see again.” But Ananias said, “Master, I have heard how this man has persecuted the Viʔ və byɨmə və.” Nyìngòŋ answered him, “Go! I have chosen him to declare my name to the Jews and to people from other people groups. He will suffer many things for my name.”

So Ananias went to Sɔ, placed his hands on him, and said, “Yesù, who appeared to you on your way here, sent me to you so that you can regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” Sɔ immediately was able to see again, and Ananias baptized him. Then Sɔ ate some food and his strength returned.

Right away, Sɔ began preaching to the Jews in Dàmaskùs, saying, “Yesù is the Son of Nyìngòŋ!” The Jews were amazed that the man who had tried to destroy the Viʔ və byɨmə və now also believed in Yesù! Sɔ reasoned with the Jews, proving that Yesù was the Messiah.

After many days, the Jews made a plan to kill Sɔ. They sent people to watch for him at the city gates in order to kill him. But Sɔ heard about the plan, and his friends helped him escape. One night they lowered him over the city wall in a basket. After Sɔ escaped from Dàmaskùs, he continued to preach about Yesù.

Sɔ went to Yèlusalèm to meet with the disciples, but they were afraid of him. Then a believer named Barnabas took Sɔ to the apostles and told them how Sɔ had preached boldly in Dàmaskùs. After that, the disciples accepted Sɔ.

Some Viʔ və byɨmə və who fled from the persecution in Yèlusalèm went far away to the city of Antioch and preached about Yesù. Most of the people in Antioch were not Jews, but for the first time, very many of them also became Viʔ və byɨmə və. Barnabas and Sɔ went there to teach these new Viʔ və byɨmə və more about Yesù and to strengthen the church. It was at Antioch that Viʔ və byɨmə və in Yesù were first called “Viʔ və byɨmə və.”

One day, while the Viʔ və byɨmə və at Antioch were fasting and praying, the Holy Spirit said to them, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Sɔ to do the work I have called them to do.” So the church in Antioch prayed for Barnabas and Sɔ and placed their hands on them. Then they sent them out to preach the good news about Yesù in many other places. Barnabas and Sɔ taught people from different people groups, and many people believed in Yesù.
