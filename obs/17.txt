Sɔl nzìtə̀ li ə̀ sə̀ bànə̀ Devìd byi jì a viʔi nkòŋə̀ wen fa tsu. Sɔl tried many times to kill him, so Devìd hid from Sɔl . One day, Sɔl was looking for Devì d so he could kill him. Sɔl went into the same cave where Devì d was hiding from Sɔl, but Sɔl did not see him. Devì d was now very close to Sɔl and could have killed him, but he did not. Instead, Devì d cut off a piece of Sɔl clothes to prove to Sɔl that he would not kill him in order to become king.

Eventually, Sɔl died in battle, and Devì d became king of Israel. He was a good king, and the people loved him. Nyìngòŋ blessed Devì d and made him successful. Devì d fought many battles and Nyìngòŋ helped him defeat Israel’s enemies. Devì d conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital city. During Devì d reign, Israel became powerful and wealthy.

Devì d wanted to build a temple where all the Israelites could worship Nyìngòŋ and offer him sacrifices. For about 400 years, the people had been worshiping Nyìngòŋ and offering sacrifices to him at the Tent of Meeting that Musìs had built.

But Nyìngòŋ sent the prophet Nathan to Devì d with this message, “Because you are a man of war, you will not build this Temple for me. Your son will build it. But, I will bless you greatly. One of your descendants will rule as king over my people forever!” The only descendant of Devì d who could rule forever was the Messiah. The Messiah was Nyìngòŋ Chosen One who would save the people of the world from their sin.

When Devì d heard these words, he immediately thanked and praised Nyìngòŋ because he had promised Devì d this great honor and many blessings. Devì d did not know when Nyìngòŋ would do these things. But as it happened, the Israelites would have to wait a long time before the Messiah came, almost 1,000 years.

Devì d ruled with justice and faithfulness for many years, and Nyìngòŋ blessed him. However, toward the end of his life he sinned terribly against Nyìngòŋ .

One day, when all of Devì d soldiers were away from home fighting battles, he looked out from his palace and saw a beautiful woman bathing. Her name was Batshebà.

Instead of looking away, Devì d sent someone to bring her to him. He slept with her and sent her back home. A short time later Batshebà sent a message to Devì d saying that she was pregnant.

Bathsheba’s husband, a man named Uliyà , was one of Devì d best soldiers. Devì d called Uliyà back from the battle and told him to go be with his wife. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So Devì d sent Uriah back to the battle and told the general to place him where the enemy was strongest so that he would be killed.

After Uliyà was killed, Devì d married Batshebà. Later, she gave birth to Devì d son. Nyìngòŋ was very angry about what Devì d had done, so he sent the prophet Nathan to tell Devì d how evil his sin was. Devì d repented of his sin and Nyìngòŋ forgave him. For the rest of his life, Devì d followed and obeyed Nyìngòŋ , even in difficult times.

But as punishment for Devì d sin, his baby boy died. There was also fighting in Devì d family for the rest of his life, and Devì d power was greatly weakened. Though Devì d had been unfaithful to Nyìngòŋ , Nyìngòŋ was still faithful to his promises. Later, Devì d and Batshebà had another son, and they named him Sòlomòn.
