Mèri was engaged to a righteous man named Jòsəf. When he heard that Mèri was pregnant, he knew it was not his baby. He did not want to shame Mèri , so he planned to quietly divorce her. Before he could do that, an ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ came and spoke to him in a dream.

N tsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ gàʔ , “Jò sə f , do not be afraid to take Mèri  as your wife. The baby that is in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son. Name him Yesù (which means, ‘Yahweh saves’), because he will save the people from their sins.”

So Jò sə f married Mèri and took her home as his wife, but he did not sleep with her until she had given birth.

When the time was near for Mèri to give birth, the Roman government told everyone to go for a census to the town where their ancestors had lived. Jò sə f and Mèri had to make a long journey from where they lived in Nazarèt to Betòlòhim because their ancestor was David whose hometown was Betòlòhim.

When they arrived in Betòlòhim , there was no place to stay. The only room they could find was a place where animals stayed. The baby was born there and his mother laid him in a feeding trough, since they did not have a bed for him. They named him Yesù .

That night, there were some ntsɨ̀ŋ sə̀ byisə in a nearby field guarding their flocks. Suddenly, a shining ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ appeared to them, and they were terrified. Ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ gàʔ , “Do not be afraid, because I have some good news for you. The Messiah, the Master, has been born in Betòlòhim !”

“Go search for the baby, and you will find him wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a feeding trough.” Suddenly, the skies were filled with ntsɨ̀ŋ sə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ praising Nyìngòŋ, saying, “Glory to Nyìngòŋ in heaven and peace on earth to the people he favors!”

N tsɨ̀ŋ sə̀ byisə ashìsə soon arrived at the place where Yesù was and they found him lying in a feeding trough, just as the ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ ngə̀ŋ ə̀ Nyìngòŋ had told them. They were very excited. Ntsɨ̀ŋ ə̀ byisə ashìsə returned to the fields where their sheep were, praising Nyìngòŋ for all they had heard and seen.

Sometime later, wise men from countries far to the east saw an unusual star in the sky. They realized it meant a new king of the Jews had been born. So, they traveled a great distance to see this king. They came to Betòlòhim and found the house where Yesù and his parents were staying.

When the wise men saw Yesù with his mother, they bowed down and worshiped him. They gave Yesù expensive gifts. Then they returned home.
